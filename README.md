# Dynamic-Array2 This C# program implements a **dynamic array** system that processes a series of queries to manipulate and retrieve data from multiple sequences based on XOR and modular arithmetic.
It builds `n` lists, updates or retrieves elements depending on the query type, tracks the latest answer with `lastAnswer`, and outputs the collected results.
